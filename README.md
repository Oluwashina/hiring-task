## Project Structure

### Backend
The `backend` folder contains the server-side code. It is responsible for handling API requests, managing business logic, and database interactions.

### Frontend
The `frontend` folder contains the client-side React application. It is responsible for providing a user interface and consuming APIs from the backend.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **SQL** (or any database of your choice)
- **Other libraries/frameworks** (add as applicable)

### Frontend
- **React.js**
- **CSS Framework** (TailwindCss)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     DB_TYPE = "mysql"
     DB_HOST = "localhost"
     DB_USERNAME = "root"
     DB_PASSWORD = 
     DB_PORT = 3306
     DB_NAME = "todo_list"
     PORT = 8000
     SECRET_KEY = "todo_list"
     EXPIRE_TIME = 3600
     ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The backend server should now run at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
